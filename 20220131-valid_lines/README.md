Problem Statement
-----------------

> If you have a 20*20 finite, discrete, square grid, and you randomly light up three squares anywhere on the grid (uniform distribution), what is the probability that all three squares are collinear?
> Collinear meaning if you connect the center of the three squares, they fall on the same straight line.
